# GEDCOMStd - 0.0.2 #

An implementation of GEDFORM for GEDCOM 5.5.1. GEDCOM may be
technically dead but everyone still uses it. Its ubiquity is its saving grace.
Although there are many different bespoke implementations the standard remains
a very solid foundation for transferring geneological data.

There may in the future be an XML based implementation similar to GEDCOM but
until that time and even, in my opinion, when that time has come and gone the
original GEDCOM standard will remain as the most commonly used transmission
standard of this sort.
